.Sh NAME
.Nm crypto ,
.Nm cryptodev
.Nd hardware crypto access driver
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd device crypto
.Cd device cryptodev
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver provides a device-independent framework to support
cryptographic operations in the kernel.
The
.Nm cryptodev
driver provides userland applications access to this support
through the
.Pa /dev/crypto
device.
This node primarily operates in an
.Xr ioctl 2
based model, permitting a variety of applications to query device capabilities,
submit transactions, and get results.
.Pp
If
.Ar count
given in the specification, and is greater than 0, a maximum of one
.Nm
device is created.
.Pp
The following
.Xr ioctl 2
calls apply only to the
.Nm
devices:
.Bl -tag -width ".Dv CIOCGSESSION"
.It Dv CIOCGSESSION
Setup a new crypto session for a new type of operation.
.It Dv CIOCFSESSION
Free a previously established session.
.It Dv CIOCCRYPT
Perform a crypto operation against a previously setup session.
.El
.Sh FEATURES
Depending on hardware being present, the following symmetric and
asymmetric cryptographic features are potentially available from
.Pa /dev/crypto :
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width ".Dv CRYPTO_RIPEMD160_HMAC" -offset indent -compact
.It Dv CRYPTO_DES_CBC
.It Dv CRYPTO_3DES_CBC
.It Dv CRYPTO_BLF_CBC
.It Dv CRYPTO_CAMELLIA_CBC
.It Dv CRYPTO_CAST_CBC
.It Dv CRYPTO_SKIPJACK_CBC
.It Dv CRYPTO_MD5_HMAC
.It Dv CRYPTO_SHA1_HMAC
.It Dv CRYPTO_RIPEMD160_HMAC
.It Dv CRYPTO_MD5_KPDK
.It Dv CRYPTO_SHA1_KPDK
.It Dv CRYPTO_AES_CBC
.It Dv CRYPTO_ARC4
.It Dv CRYPTO_MD5
.It Dv CRYPTO_SHA1
.It Dv CRK_MOD_EXP
.It Dv CRK_MOD_EXP_CRT
.It Dv CRK_DSA_SIGN
.It Dv CRK_DSA_VERIFY
.It Dv CRK_DH_COMPUTE_KEY

.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
driver first appeared in
.Ox 3.0 .
The
.Nm
driver was imported to
.Fx 5.0 .
.Sh BUGS
Error checking and reporting is weak.
.Pp
The values specified for symmetric-key key sizes to
.Dv CIOCGSESSION
must exactly match the values expected by
.Xr opencrypto 9 .
The output buffer and MAC buffers supplied to
.Dv CIOCCRYPT
must follow whether privacy or integrity algorithms were specified for
session: if you request a
.No non- Ns Dv NULL
algorithm, you must supply a suitably-sized buffer.
.Pp
The scheme for passing arguments for asymmetric requests is baroque.
.Pp
The naming inconsistency between
.Dv CRIOGET
and the various
.Dv CIOC Ns \&*
names is an unfortunate historical artifact.
