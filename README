$FreeBSD$

This directory contains a collection of scripts and their corresponding
configurations to set up continuous testing hosts on the Kyua cluster.

Be aware that most of the code in here exists only as temporary glue.  The
goal is for Kyua itself to offer most or all of the functionality
implemented in these scripts.  However, doing so in a generic manner will
require a significant amount of effort; in the meantime, it is easier to
just do all the work in relatively-straightforward scripts that are
specific to FreeBSD.

As weird as it may be, the code in here is designed to be executed, on
purpose, from its source directory.  There is no way to install it under,
say, /usr/local.  Doing so would require some minor changes to ensure the
paths are valid but I did not see the point of supporting this.  In
general, the machines will just "svn update" the code in this directory,
run "make" again and go on their merry way while allowing the backgrounded
jobs to pick up the new versions (if any).


node directory
--------------

Scripts and configuration files to set up a single Kyua cluster node.

To configure a machine as a node, just run "./node/setup".  This command
will install any necessary prerequisites, build the scripts, enable the
background processing loop in rc.d and start it.  Arguments to the "setup"
script are passed directly to make, so they can be used to override
settings for the particular host being configured (e.g. the path to shtk).

Of special interest are:

* node/iterate: Builds a release, creates a fresh disk image that runs the
  tests on execution, executes the image in a VM and collects the test
  results.

* node/loop: Executes node/iterate in an infinite loop with one or more
  release configurations.

* node/configs/: Configuration files for node/iterate.  node/loop picks all
  of them up and runs them in sequence.

* node/rc.d/autotest-node: rc.d script to run node/loop as a daemon.
