Ports needed for successful build:
---------------------------------
1) print/texlive-full - recommended as we have not yet figured out minimal set of
ports needed to build successfully.
2) print/pdfjam	- needed to generate a single combined course.pdf file.

How to build:
------------
"make" builds all the individual chapters in side their respective directories
as lection.pdf

"make course" concatenates all individual chapter lection.pdf files into one
course.pdf

"make clean" deletes all temporary files.

"make cleanall" deletes resulting pdf files in addition to all temporary files.
