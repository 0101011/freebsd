Notes:

generated on freefall via:

  ~gnats/tools/do_email_annotated_prs [user] [filename] [html_mode]

user is mandatory.

If you do not specify filename the script will look for a file named
pr_emailtemplate.txt in ~[user]/public_html/.

html_mode may be 1 to send HTML mail, or 0 or omitted not to.

The input format is fairly free-form: any line that starts with a numeric
is magically assumed to be a PR number; otherwise it is simply copied to
the output.  The magic string %QUERY_PR is a metadirective.

Closed PRs are automagically filtered out by default, but can be shown
if desired.

Note: to view an individual PR, use:
