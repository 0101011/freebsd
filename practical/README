All practical sessions require a shell box shared between lecturer and
students. I use dedicated FreeBSD-CURRENT instance under bhyve. All
students are provided shell and superuser there. Students are encouraged
to run things on their own boxes or VMs, but shared shellbox is always
available.

Problems(bhyve):
- It is impossible to share kernel debugger console to students, it requires
  root on host. So only lecturer can work once VM goes into ddb.
- Sometimes when VM enters ddb, the bhyve process exits.

During entire practical session the beamer displays my terminal. I use
Xterm running fullscreen w/o any widgets and using
x11-fonts/inconsolata-lgc-ttf font. I encourage students to do some steps
theirselves, in these cases I use watch(8) on students' tty to intercept
it and make viewable by everyone on beamer.

Problems:
- If watch(8) a terminal that is bigger than yours, you got a mess on
  screen (and on beamer, too!).
- Modules should be build with DEBUG_FLAGS=-g knob, so that any kgdb
  session display their symbols. This secret knowledge isn't documented :(
