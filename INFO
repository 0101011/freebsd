Here is 'http support for PXE' project snapshot at 19th of August
(last submit during GSoC).

There was post GSoC submit and may be will be ready next changes at time you are
reading this sentence, so repository contents differs from this tarball. Also,
deleted at the end phase of project files (e.g. pxe_mutex module) and unused
after all (btx_mod directory) are not included to this tarball.
