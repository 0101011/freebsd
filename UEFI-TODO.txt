/* FreeBSD */

Part the First: 64-bit EFI loader

+ Make libstand build natively as 64-bit on amd64.
+ Adjust non-EFI boot code to use /usr/lib32/libstand.a.
- Test that the other boot code still actually works.
- Add bits to build 64-bit loader.efi.
- Make sure that loader.efi can actually load a kernel and hand off to it.

Part the Second: Booting an amd64 kernel from the 64-bit EFI loader

- Work out how to pass the memory map from EFI to the kernel.
- Fix anything else that comes up.

Part the Third: Booting an i386 kernel from the 64-bit EFI loader.

- Make sure that the i386 kernel isn't trying to touch the BIOS.
- Fix anything else that comes up.

Part the Fourth: Making our install media UEFI compatible.

- Work out how to make our install media UEFI compatible.
- Make our install media UEFI compatible.

Part the Miscellaneous:

- Add __attribute__((ms_abi)) support to clang/llvm.
- Try to work out a sane arrangement for sys/boot that makes it easier to
  deal with the whole 32/64-bit thing.
