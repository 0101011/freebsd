#	Use this file to store mappings between submitter IDs and their
#	senders' email addresses.
#
#	Entries are of the form:
#
#submitter-id:address-fragment
#
#	where submitter-id is a valid submitter ID, and address-fragment
#	is a full or partial e-mail address.  Fragments are compared to the
#	end of the "From:" header of a Problem Report.  GNATS ignores the
#	trailing ">" of an incoming e-mail address, so you don't need to
#	include it in an address fragment.
