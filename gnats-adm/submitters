#		    submitters database for GNATS
#
# Any line which begins with a `#' is considered a comment, and GNATS
# will ignore it. 
#
# Each entry has the format:
# 
#	submitter:full submitter name:type:response-time:contact:notify-others
#
#	* submitter: The name of the site, customer, etc., sending the
#	  report in.
#	* full submitter name: The description, like `Foo Widgets Inc.'.
#	* submitter type: Can be contract type, level of expertise, etc.
#	* response time: If configured with `NOTIFY' set to `TRUE', GNATS
#	  will use this field to schedule when at_pr should notify the
#	  gnats-admin and gnats-manager that the PR wasn't analyzed
#	  within the agreed response time.
#	* contact: Principal contact for the submitter.
#	* notify: Others who should be Cc'd on any PRs coming from
#	  this submitter.
#
#
# The following submitter is mandatory for GNATS to work.
# The submitter field should be the same as your configured DEFAULT_SUBMITTER.
